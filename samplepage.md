**Sample page**

This is just a sample page with some sample text for all those cases where you don't have any text available yet and just need some longer text to display on a page for demo purposes.

**First paragraph**

After the short introduction now follows a first short paragraph, which has also been provided with a small heading. In the body text it should also be possible to work with the elementary MarkDown markup, e.g. to set a passage *italic*.
Either single *asterisks* can be used to mark up the desired text, or you can use _underscores_ instead of asterisks.
